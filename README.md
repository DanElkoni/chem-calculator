Developed by Fallvirus009 (Daniel Elkoni) 
## **UPDATE LOG:**
### **Chemistry Calculator v0.0.1:**
Has some features currently, gonna expand and add gui along the line
Currently for storing atomic mass numbers and using them to calculate the percentage they make up in a certain compound
### **UPDATE v.0.0.2**
Just added gram to mol and mol to gram conversion!
### **UPDATE v0.0.3:**
After gram to mol or mol to gram converison the number of molecules of your compound is now diplayed!
### **UPDATE v0.0.4:**
Added a logging compounds function which tracks the name and molar mass, just a quick addition for the start!
### **UPDATE v.0.0.6**
Bunch of new stuff, faster cleaner code, rewritten functions (not messy this time), and the big, big thing... **GUI**!!!! </br>
Finally added a functioning working GUI, which works and looks great! </br>
Use the bottom box to log your elements with their masses, then you can enter your compound name with element amounts up to **1000**
### **PATCH v.0.0.6 p1**
Fixed a bug that added too many ones when using compounds such as H2SO4

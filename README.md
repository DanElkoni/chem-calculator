## **Small chemistry calculator to help anyone who needs it!**
Heres a small chemistry calculator to help with all kinds of chemistry calculations! Feel free to change around, mess with the code, and try your own functions. If you do distribute or use **ANY** of this code for commercial purposes, all I ask is you link this github page. Thanks for stopping by!</br>

## **UPDATE LOG:**
### **Chemistry Calculator v0.0.1:**
Has some features currently, gonna expand and add gui along the line
Currently for storing atomic mass numbers and using them to calculate the percentage they make up in a certain compound
### **UPDATE v.0.0.2**
Just added gram to mol and mol to gram conversion!
### **UPDATE v0.0.3:**
After gram to mol or mol to gram converison the number of molecules of your compound is now diplayed!
### **UPDATE v0.0.4:**
Added a logging compounds function which tracks the name and molar mass, just a quick addition for the start!
### **UPDATE v.0.0.6**
Bunch of new stuff, faster cleaner code, rewritten functions (not messy this time), and the big, big thing... **GUI**!!!! </br>
Finally added a functioning working GUI, which works and looks great! </br>
Use the bottom box to log your elements with their masses, then you can enter your compound name with element amounts up to **1000**
### **PATCH v0.0.6 p1**
Fixed a bug that added too many ones when using compounds such as H2SO4
### **PATCH v0.0.6 p2**
Fixed a bug regarding two letter element symbols such as Ca </br>
**Bug:** Ca would be split into 'C' and 'a' internally, which caused many issues
